# test, this repository is a test for printf

# Project:0x11.C-printf

## Introduction:

In this project, we are creating our own printf function. To do this project we must have in mind, all the concepts and resources that have been seen so far. Another thing to consider is the teamwork that must be done and follow the proposed *Framework*.

## Description:

The task **0x11.C-printf** consist in write our own **printf** function, meeting the proposed requirements(see below). We will build a functi
n that can produce terminal outputs of all formats, like printf function also we creates a man page for our own function.


## Requirements:

### General:

+ Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
+ Your programs and functions will be compiled with **gcc 4.8.4** using the flags **-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic**
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A **README.md file**, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
+ Your code should use the **Betty** style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
+ You are not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ In the following examples, the **main.c** files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push t
hem to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own **main.c** files at compilation. Our **main.c** files might
be different from the one shown in the examples
+ The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called **holberton.h**
+ Don’t forget to push your header file
+ All your header files should be include guarded
+ Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

### Github

**There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadl
ine, you risk a 0% score.**
